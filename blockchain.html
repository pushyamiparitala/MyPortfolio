    A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography.
    Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data 
    (generally represented as a Merkle tree). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when
    the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the 
    block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. 
    Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, 
    the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
    Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, 
    where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks.</p>

    Although blockchain records are not unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure 
    by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.
    The blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to 
    serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains 
    unknown to date. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the 
    double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has 
    inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by 
    cryptocurrencies. The blockchain is considered a type of payment rail. Private blockchains have been proposed 
    for business use but Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper 
    security model "snake oil". However, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed,
    may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.
